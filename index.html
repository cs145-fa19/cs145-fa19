        <h2>Course Overview Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This course covers database design and the use of databases in applications, with a short introduction to the internals of relational database engines, the relational model, relational algebra, and SQL.</p>
        <p>Students will also learn about database design and relational design principles based on dependencies and normal forms as well as many additional key database topics from the design and application-building
          perspective. This will include indexes, views, transactions, and integrity constraints. We'll also introduce MapReduce framework and key-value stores.</p>
        <p>The class will culminate in a hands-on programming project in SQL+Python &mdash; a key part of the course &mdash; where you will query, visualize and predict from terabytes of data on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a>,
          a popular cloud database part of Google Cloud Platform.</p>

        <b>Piazza</b> Join our Piazza</a> to receive important
        announcements and get answers to your questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Homeworks</b> Homeworks are self-paced and do not affect your
        course grade. However, they reflect the exam material, so it is in
        your best interest to complete them promptly, for each lecture.
        Aside from preparing you for the exam, they will assess and reinforce
        your understanding of the material.

        You can access the homeworks through <a href="http://www.newgradiance.com/services">Gradiance</a>
        by creating an account (if you don't already have one) then signing
        up for class token <b>E68759F1</b>. Once you have joined the class, navigate
        to the Homeworks section on the left. <b>NOTE:</b> when we write "lab"
        we indicate that you should do the corresponding lab found in the "Lab Projects" tab,
        instead of the Homework tab.
      </p>

      <b>Exam Dates</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Midterm: in-class midterm on TBD</li>
        <li>
          Final: Friday, Dec 9th from 7:00-10:00 p.m. (see <a href="https://registrar.stanford.edu/autumn-quarter-exams">university
          final exam scheduling</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Exam Notes Sheet</b> For the midterm, we allow
        students 1 two-sided 8.5x11" piece of paper with typed or written
        notes.

        For the <i>final exam</i> we will allow students <b>two</b> notes sheets.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Late Days</b> You are allowed a total of <b>three</b> late days
        shared between all project deadlines. You do not lose any credit when
        using a late day. If you run out of late days and submit after the
        deadline, you receive a 0. (EDIT: this was increased from 2 to 3 due
        to P2 submission difficulties. For more, see piazza post 879).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Lectures</b> Lectures occur on Tues/Thurs 4:30-5:50 p.m. in NVIDIA Auditorium. NOTE that while attendance is not mandatory,
        we will be giving out extra credit for students with insightful in-class participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Lecture Videos</b> Lecture videos will be recorded and posted on <a href="https://canvas.stanford.edu/">Canvas</a>.
      </p>

      <b>Textbook</b> There is no required textbook, but for students who want additional resources, we recommend the following two:
      <ul>
        <li>Database Systems 2nd Edition by Garcia-Molina</li>
        <li>First Course in Database Systems 3rd Edition by Ullman</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Accomodations</b> Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate
        the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE) and notify us at least 7 days (ONE week) prior to the Midterm
        and/or Final Exam.
      </p>

        <hr>
        <p>
          <b>Group Size</b> The first two projects are individual only, but the third project you are allowed
          to work in teams of two.

          <p>
            <b>Project Submissions</b>
            You will submit your projects via Gradescope. Sign up for Gradescope
            using your Stanford email address and student ID. The course code is
            MJ3ZYR.

            Each assignment will include specific instructions regarding what
            files to submit.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Regrade Policy</b>
            If you think that we've made a grading mistake or that the work
            you submitted should be regraded, submit a regrade request on
            Gradescope within one week of receiving your grade. Be sure that you
            prepare a short and convincing argument on Gradescope about why you
            think your work was incorrectly graded â€“ we reserve the right to
            ignore your regrade request if you don't provide a justification.

            If you submit a regrade request, we reserve the right to regrade your
            entire assignment. This means that your overall score could go
            down.
